<li><p><b>Deep Q-Learning based PC Game</b> (<i>Course Project: Neural Networks</i>) [Spring 2017]<br />
<i>Mentor- Prof. Laxmidhar Behera, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i><b>Objective:</b>Control a car in a PC game using reinforcement learning such that the car collects as many coins as possible and avoids as many obstacles possible.</i>	 <br/>	  
<i><b>Algorithm:</b>Collected the frame from the game and was fed to a CNN for object identification, followed by an Actor network which gave the next move to be played and was provided with the feedback mechanism of Q-Learning. Feedback consisted of both penalty and reward.</i>	 <br/>
<i><b> Result:</b>The car showed excellent performance in both avoiding obstacles and collecting coins.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Design of Control System for Team AUV-IITK Vehicle VARUN</b>      [Jun&rsquo;14-Jan’15]<br />                          
<i>Mentor- Prof. Ram Prasad Potluri, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i>    <br />            	                  
An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle was being developed by Team AUV-IITK for representing IIT Kanpur in AUVSI RoboSub at San Diego in Aug&rsquo;15. A simplified dynamic model for the AUV and its Simulink model was created implementing a simple PID control. Underwater experiments were performed for finding the undetermined coefficients. A GUI was designed in MATLAB for conducting experiments for acquiring and analyzing data from the sensors. Arduino micro-controllers were used for controlling the motors.</p>

<li><p><b>Robotics Club, IIT Kanpur</b> [May&rsquo;14-Jun&rsquo;14]<br />					
<i>Hull and Torpedo Design, Team AUV-IITK</i>	<br />					                            
An AUV was manufactured along with 6 team members for the purpose of future testing and experiments. Hull, Torpedoes, Thrusters, Camera Casings, Waterproof Connectors and Battery Casing were designed, manufactured and tested. The designs were made using Inventor and Solidworks. The manufacturing was done using the lab facilities like Water-jet and Laser cutting. The vehicle was made neutrally buoyant and waterproof. The testing was done in the institute swimming pool.</p>

<li><p><b>Honeywell Young Innovator Challenge</b>                                                                                 	               [Dec&rsquo;13-May’14]<br />
Selected for the National Finals in the Honeywell YIC&rsquo; 13. Prepared a project report on the topic &ldquo;Water Purification by Photo-catalytic Oxidation Process using Nano-crystalline Titanium Oxide&rdquo;. Project focused on developing a water purification solution using a renewable source of energy like the Sun.</p>

<li><p><b>Takneek ‘13</b>          [Aug’13-Sep’13] <br />
<i>College Level Robotics Competition</i><br />									   
A remote controlled, line following and obstacle avoiding robot was developed along with a team of five students. T-SOP infrared sensor and Atmega microcontroller were used for the working of the robot, which could lift and place balls and various similar sized objects from one place to another.</p>
