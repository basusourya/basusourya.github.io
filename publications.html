A detection algorithm for Large MIMO systems has been derived using a Tree Search based algorithm coupled with a novel Error Likelihood metric for branching and emplyoing an Interior Point based QP solver. The algorithm provides near-optimal results and is more accurate and efficient than most of the available low complexity detection techniques. The error performance and complexity results have been verified numerically by numerous simulations in MATLAB for various antenna dimensions and QAM constellation sizes.<br />

<i>Mentor - Dr. Ketan Rajawat</i> <br />
<i>Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i> <br />  
A critical analysis was done for a paper proposing an algorithm for network distance prediction using matrix factorization. After studying the algorithm and its advantages, it was implemented in MATLAB for reproduction and verification of results. The arguments presented were checked and weak claims were pointed out. Simulations were also carried out for scenarios which were not considered in the paper thus confirming whether the algorithm was applicable in the experimentally unverified cases of networks.<br />

<i>Mentor - Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari</i> <br />
<i>Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA</i>  <br />                                       
An online learning algorithm was proposed and simulated to learn the optimal sensing policy for wireless mobile devices which minimizes average user state estimation error under a given energy budget constraint. The system was modelled as a Markov Decision Process and the problem was reduced to solving an equivalent Linear Program. The simulations were carried out in Python using CVXPY library and showed feasible regret as compared to the genie. The mathematical proof of the applicability and regret bounds of the algorithm were then derived.</p>

<i>Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i> <br />
The performance analysis results were found for dual hop MIMO mixed free space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) systems. The expressions for outage probability and average bit error rate for various modulation schemes were derived in the form of generalized infinite power series using amplify-forward and channel-state-information (CSI) assisted relaying. MATLAB simulations were carried out to verify the accuracy of the results.<br />

A qualitative analysis of the ECG data using complex Gaussian wavelets to investigate the multi-scale, self-similar behavior and deviation via phase plots of the wavelet cross spectrum of ECG signals was performed in order to classify various cardiovascular diseases. ECG signals were further analyzed using S transform to overcome the limitations of continuous wavelet transform and make the results more consistent and reliable.<br />

<i>Mentor-Dr. S. R. Sahoo</i><br />
<i>Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i><br />                                                                                                
The dynamics of a Quadcopter were studied and modelled. A PID Control System was developed for controlling the yaw-pitch-roll of the Quadcopter. The modelling, simulations and analysis were performed using MATLAB and Simulink. Dronekit API was used to communicate the Quadcopter autopilot with a companion computer over an RF link with MAVlink protocol. Vision algorithms were developed to identify a given size and color marker. Commands coded in Python were sent from the computer to the flight control board. </p>

<i>Mentor-Prof. K. S. Venkatesh</i><br />
<i>Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur</i><br />                                                                                                 
A practical method was developed to predict the future spatial temporal trajectories of vehicles at road intersections using a catadioptric omnidirectional camera equipped with an equiangular mirror. Tracking was done using the Camshift algorithm running alongside a Kalman filter to handle occlusions. Domain transformation from image space to real world was done using a geometric model. A computationally effective model for future trajectory prediction was developed and simulated with available video dataset.<br />
